# Cinematic Showcase: A Dynamic Movie Review Website

## Project Overview
You've built a comprehensive movie review website called "Stephan's Cinematic Showcase". This web application combines dynamic content management with user authentication, providing a platform for movie enthusiasts to explore top-ranked films across various genres.

## Key Features
1. **User Authentication**: The system includes a login panel, distinguishing between regular users and administrators.

2. **Admin Dashboard**: 
   - Accessible to users with admin privileges
   - Displays key statistics: Total Films, Directors, Total Awards, and Average Rating
   - Provides a detailed table of films with information such as title, director, year, ranking, and awards
   - Allows admins to edit or delete film entries directly from the dashboard

3. **Film Catalog**: 
   - Presents a curated list of top-ranked films
   - Each film entry includes a title, brief description, and genre tags
   - Films are categorized by genres like Drama, Action, Fantasy, Crime, etc.

4. **Genre Filtering**: Users can filter films by genre, enhancing the browsing experience

5. **Responsive Design**: The UI appears to be clean, modern, and likely responsive for various device sizes

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (possibly with a framework like Bootstrap for the clean, card-based layout)
- **Backend**: PHP
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Authentication**: Custom-built using PHP and database integration

## Notable Aspects
- The project demonstrates a good grasp of full-stack web development, combining frontend design with backend functionality.
- The admin dashboard provides a comprehensive overview and management system for the film database.
- The user interface is intuitive, with clear navigation and visually appealing presentation of film information.
- Integration of user roles (admin vs regular user) shows an understanding of access control in web applications.

## Potential Enhancements
- Implement user reviews and ratings
- Add a search functionality
- Expand the admin capabilities to add new films or genres
- Integrate with external APIs for additional film data or images

This project showcases your skills in creating a functional, database-driven web application with a focus on content management and user experience in the domain of film reviews and cataloging.
