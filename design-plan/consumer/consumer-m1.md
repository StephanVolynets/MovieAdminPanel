# Project 3, Milestone 1: **Consumer** Design Journey

[← Table of Contents](../design-journey.md)

## _Cohesive_ Audience
> Briefly explain your site's **consumer** audience.
> Your audience should be specific, but not arbitrarily specific.

 Enthusiasts of great films and documentaries.

> Be specific and justify why this audience is a **cohesive** group. (1-2 sentences)

This audience is cohesive because its members share a strong interest in niche film genres, often seeking educational and thought-provoking content that is not typically found in mainstream media outlets.


## Audience Goals
> Document your **consumer** audience's goals.
> List each goal below. There is no specific number of goals required for this, but you need
> enough to do the job (Hint: It's at least 1, but probably no more than 3).

1. Discover New Content: Users want to easily discover new indie films and documentaries that match their interests.
2. Access Detailed Information: Users seek in-depth details about films, such as directorial style, themes, and user-generated reviews.
3. Engage with Community: Users wish to engage with a community of like-minded enthusiasts, sharing recommendations and discussions about content.


## Persona
> Use the goals you identified to develop a persona of your site's **consumer** audience.
> Your persona must have a name and a face. The face can be a photo of a face or a drawing, etc.
> You may type out the persona below with bullet points or include an image of the persona.
> Just make sure it's easy to read the persona when previewing markdown.
