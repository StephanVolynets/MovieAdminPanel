# Project 3, Milestone 1: **Team** Design Journey

[← Table of Contents](design-journey.md)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class (includes the design prerequisite for this course).**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality.

## Catalog
> What will your catalog website be about? (1 sentence)

TODO: catalog topic


## Narrow or Wide Screen
> How will your **consumer** user access this website? From a narrow or wide screen?

TODO: narrow or wide screen


## Catalog Design
> Sketch each page of your entire media catalog website
> Provide a brief explanation _underneath_ each sketch. (1 sentence per sketch)
> **Refer to consumer or administrator persona by name in each explanation.**

TODO: sketch(es) + explanation


## Catalog Design Patterns
> Explain how your design employs common catalog design patterns. (1-2 sentences)

TODO: design pattern explanation


## URL Design
> Plan your HTTP routing.
> List each route and the PHP file for each route.

| Page                                     | Route       | PHP File       |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| home / consumer view all / filter by tag | /           | pages/home.php |
| consumer entry details                   | TODO: route | TODO: php file |
| admin view all / filter by tag           | TODO: route | TODO: php file |
| admin insert entry                       | TODO: route | TODO: php file |
| admin edit entry / tag / untag           | TODO: route | TODO: php file |
| login                                    | TODO: route | TODO: php file |

> Explain why these routes (URLs) are usable for your persona. (1 sentence)

TODO: justification of routing design



## Database Schema
> Plan the structure of your database. You may use words or a picture.
> A bulleted list is probably the simplest way to do this.
> Include constraints for each field.

**Table:** TODO: table name

- field1: TYPE {constraints...},
- field2: ...
- TODO: table fields + type + constraints
