[← Table of Contents](../design-journey.md)

## _Cohesive_ Audience
> Briefly explain your site's **administrator** audience.
> Your audience should be specific, but not arbitrarily specific.

### Audience Description

- Site Moderators and Content Managers


- > Be specific and justify why this audience is a **cohesive** group. (1-2 sentences)

### Cohesiveness Justification

- This group is cohesive because all members share the common responsibility of managing and organizing the site's content, ensuring that everything is current, accurate, and aligns with the websites purpose.


## Audience Goals
> Document your **administrator** audience's goals.
> List each goal below. There is no specific number of goals required for this, but you need
> enough to do the job (Hint: It's at least 1, but probably no more than 3).

Efficient Content Management

- Quickly add, edit, or remove media entries to keep the catalog fresh and relevant.

Secure Access Controls

- Ensure only authorized personnel can make changes to the site's content.


Organized Tagging System

- Manage tags effectively to improve content discoverability.


## Persona
> Use the goals you identified to develop a persona of your site's **administrator** audience.
> Your persona must have a name and a face. The face can be a photo of a face or a drawing, etc.
> You may type out the persona below with bullet points or include an image of the persona.
> Just make sure it's easy to read the persona when previewing markdown.
